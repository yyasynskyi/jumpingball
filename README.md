# Ball Physics Simulation

This project demonstrates a simple 2D simulation of a ball bouncing inside a circular boundary with gravity and elasticity. The ball's behavior is modeled with basic physics, including gravity and bouncing off the walls. The ball's color changes randomly.

## Features
- **Ball Physics**: The ball is affected by gravity, which increases its vertical velocity over time.
- **Elasticity**: The ball bounces off the circular boundary with a given elasticity factor, maintaining a realistic bounce.
- **Random Color Change**: The ball's color changes randomly based on its speed.
- **Boundary Collision Detection**: The ball detects collisions with the circular boundary and reacts by bouncing off the edges.
- **Counter**: Every time after ball touches the edge counter increases.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas: Used for rendering the ball and circular boundary.
- JavaScript: Provides the logic for the physics simulation and interaction.
